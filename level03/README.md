# Level 03

In this exercise we build some configuration capabilities into our application.

This exercise will require a combination of building the right types to guide
your development, plus consulting plenty of documentation to leverage the chosen
packages. There may also be, depending on your level of interest, some external
reading for later as well.

Start in ``src/FirstApp/Conf.hs``.
