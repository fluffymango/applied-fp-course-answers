# Level 01

The purpose of this exercise to whet our appetite a bit by spinning up an ultra
basic web app. The focus will be on reading
the [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) documentation for
the [Wai](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) framework. Consult the
``src/FirstApp/Main.hs`` to see the parts that are missing and what we need from
the [Wai](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) package to make our "Hello,
World!" application run.
