{-|
In Haskell the `newtype` comes with zero runtime cost. It is purely used for
typechecking. So when you have a bare 'primitive' value, like an Int, String, or
even [a], you can wrap it up in a `newtype` for clarity.

The type system will check it for you, and the compiler will eliminate the cost
once it has passed.

Not everything goes according to plan, but it's important that our
types reflect when errors can be introduced into our program. Additionally
it's useful to be able to be descriptive about what went wrong.

So lets think about some of the basic things that can wrong with our
program and create some values to represent that.
